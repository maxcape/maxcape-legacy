                    <h2>Welcome to the Iron Clan</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Iron Dragon is an Iron Man Clan. This means that all members are DIY accounts, with the exception that we can trade with, and do minigames with, eachother.
                        Formed in July 2014, we are hoping to create a large group of likeminded players dedicated to playing RuneScape with these rules added. While trading is
                        completely optional, an in-clan economy is likely to form, completely seperate from the already existing (and broken) RuneScape economy.</p>

                    <p>If you are unfamiliar with the Iron Man concept, please <a href="rules/">read the rules for the clan</a>. There is very little tolerance for breaking
                        these rules, and if you are found cheating or breaking the rules, you are likely to be kicked. Some lower priority rules may result in a warning.
                        If you are unsure if something is against the rules or not, please feel free to ask in the clan!</p>

                    <h2>Stat Tracking</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Stat Tracking is an automatic process. Every two hours the clan list will be updated, and all users stats at that point in time will be recorded. Over time,
                        this will create nice graphs of each players progress through the game. There is a 5 second delay between users stats being recorded, so if some users are
                        updated while others aren't, it's simply because of the length of time required to update all members stats.</p>

                    <p>Also available is a clan highscores. This works very much like the existing RuneScape highscores, but only displays clan members. These highscores are based
                        off of the latest stat update. Upcoming functionality will allow you to go back and view a history of the clan highscores back til July 6th 2014.</p>
